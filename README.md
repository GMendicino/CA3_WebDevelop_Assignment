Navigation:

For navigation on the website, I decided to go for a simple, yet efficient navigation bar, which allows the user to easily traverse all web pages. I also used an 'active' class which indicates which page the user is currently in. 

Layout:

The layout of the website was also made to be simple. I included a banner across all pages, followed by the navigation bar. I divided all contents across sections using the '<section>' tag, and I styled each section accordingly to maximise user readability. I also used '<div>' tag for specific classes as it helps organise content and also helps in regards to applying styles effectively. The footer is comprised of additional links and copyright info.

Colour Choices:

Originally I wanted the website to have the colour pattern of the Italian flag(red, white and green), however, I decided to also include different colours to enhance readability and make the website look more modern. 

Challenges Faced:

I faced challenges virtually across every step of the way when making this website. I struggled deciding on the layout, colour scheme and content management. I spent a lot of the time fixing mistakes in the code, sometimes, I'd fix a problem I was stumped on for hours, only to find that, that fix had caused two more problems to erupt. Making the contents of the banner be layed out appropriately took a lot of time.
